##Reading Excel Files
http://www.python-excel.org recommends openpyxl for reading and writing excel 2010 files.

Installed using `pip3 install openpyxl`.

#Current Issues / To Do

* Handling of duplicate files - some error indication
* A lookup on clinic data - sponsor, population etc
* Handling of misspellings of clinic names
* Add in some better error reporting to help people fix the mistakes in the input
* Add in a pointer to the filename
* Look at compiling to a distributable executable.
